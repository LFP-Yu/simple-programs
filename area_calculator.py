# *********  Area Calculator  *********
# What this program would do:
#   Ask the user to enter the lengths of all three sides of a triangle
#   Calculate the area of the triangle
#   Calculate the half of sum of the three sides and store it in variable s
#   If the input lengths could form a valid triangle 
#     (i.e. sum of any two sides should be greater than the third one, or
#            half of sum of all the three sides should be greater than any one side),
#       Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula:
#         area = âˆš(s(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) where a,b,c are the three sides of the triangle
#       Print out the area
#   Otherwise, print an error message and stop the program
